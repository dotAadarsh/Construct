Constructing the Quality Education with AI


### Problems

- Summarization - There has been a surge in the amount of textual data from various sources. This wealth of text contains valuable insights and must be effectively summarized in order to be useful.

- Multilingual transcript - The objective of addressing the multilingual problem in education is to create a more inclusive and accessible learning environment for students who speak languages other than the dominant language in the school or community. This can involve providing translation and interpretation services, offering bilingual or multilingual education programs, and supporting language learning in the classroom.

- Semantic search - Documents can be used to help provide quality education by allowing students to quickly and easily find the information they need. Rather than having to go through long lists of search results, students can use semantic search to find the exact information they need, saving time and making the learning process more efficient. Additionally, semantic search can help educators and administrators better organize and manage documents, as well as make them more accessible for students. This can help ensure that students are able to find the information they need quickly and easily, as well as have access to the most up-to-date versions of documents.
